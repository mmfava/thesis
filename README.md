# Eco-Epidemiology Research on Lonomism in South America

This repository is the heart of my doctoral thesis, where I'm conducting a deep dive into the eco-epidemiology of Lonomia achelous and Lonomia obliqua envenomations (lonomism) in South America.  I'm analyzing data spanning six decades (1960-2020) to uncover risk factors, host-insect relationships, and the geographical spread of these venomous caterpillars.

## What you'll find here

- Epidemiological Analysis: I've analyzed over 13,000 case reports to reveal trends, high-risk areas, and the demographics most affected by lonomism.
- Ecological Explorations: I'm examining predation, relationships between Lonomia spp. and their host plants, and using ecological niche modeling to map lonomism risk zones across the continent.
- Public Health and Conservation Focus: My goal is to support informed public health strategies and biodiversity conservation efforts by understanding the ecology of these species.
- Work-in-Progress: Some aspects of my analysis are ongoing. I welcome your feedback and collaboration!
